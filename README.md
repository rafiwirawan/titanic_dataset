Hi everyone! Welcome to my another Data Science Project. 

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

A kind of machine learning algorithms which commonly used is Decision tree. Decision trees can be used for both predicting numerical values (regression) and classifying data into categories.(Source : IBM)

Within this project i elaborated the basic concept of Decision tree using Titanic Dataset from Kaggle.
