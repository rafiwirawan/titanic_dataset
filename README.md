Hi everyone! Welcome to my another Data Science Project. 

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

A kind of machine learning algorithms which commonly used is Decision tree. Decision trees can be used for both predicting numerical values (regression) and classifying data into categories.(Source : IBM)

Within this project i elaborated the basic concept of Decision tree using Titanic Dataset from Kaggle.

Decision Tree is a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. (Source : Scikit-Learn)

Decision trees can be used for both predicting numerical values (regression) and classifying data into categories. Decision trees use a branching sequence of linked decisions that can be represented with a tree diagram. (Source : IBM)

Some advantages of decision trees are:
1. Simple to understand and to interpret. Trees can be visualized.
2. Requires little data preparation. Other techniques often require data normalization, dummy variables need to be created and blank values to be removed. Note however that this module does not support missing values.
3. The cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree.
4. Possible to validate a model using statistical tests. That makes it possible to account for the reliability of the model.
5. Performs well even if its assumptions are somewhat violated by the true model from which the data were generated.

The disadvantages of decision trees include:
1. Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalize the data well. This is called overfitting. Mechanisms such as pruning, setting the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the tree are necessary to avoid this problem.
2. Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. This problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble.
3. Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree.
